> Programming is no longer just a craft for building functionality, but a way of thinking about the future.

I often feel that the waves of the times don't wait for anyone, but there are always people who happen to stand at their forefront.  
The rise of AI, for me, is like a tailwind that has allowed me to traverse the full-stack path in a limited time that would have taken years to reach in the past.

Those details that have been polished countless times by predecessors are no longer a maze that traps me; they have become building blocks that can be used at will.  
Thus, I can devote more energy to what truly deserves deep thought:  
**The meaning of products, application scenarios, and the relationship between people and technology**.
