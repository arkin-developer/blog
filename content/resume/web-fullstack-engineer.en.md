    AI-powered video content summarization platform based on LLM APIs, addressing the challenge of efficiently digesting long videos through automated AI-generated content summaries. The platform enables video parsing and core information extraction, generating quick reading notes to assist users in rapid learning and knowledge management.

  - **Technical Solution**:
    Frontend built on open-source Open SaaS framework for web interface, supporting user upload/input of video links and summary viewing. Backend uses Golang + Eino framework to build LLM inference and toolchain services, handling video parsing, text generation, and summary output. Integrated existing LLM APIs for video content understanding and summary generation, achieving end-to-end intelligent video processing workflow.

  - **Project Results**:
    Achieved automated video content parsing and summary generation, enabling users to obtain core content of long videos within minutes. Platform supports multi-format video input and provides clear, readable note output, improving information acquisition efficiency by approximately 5-10x (compared to manual video watching). Completely independently developed, covering frontend pages, backend inference services, and toolchain integration, demonstrating full-stack development capabilities and AI application implementation skills.

- ### Digital Platform Tour Guide Project (2024.05-2024.12)

  - **Project Overview**:
    Web-based tour guide application combining GIS technology with LLM intelligent services, addressing tourism platform users' difficulties in quickly planning itineraries in unfamiliar cities. Developed intelligent tour guide platform that automatically generates personalized travel route recommendations and visualizes them on digital Earth, while providing interactive explanations to help users quickly understand attraction characteristics and regional information.

  - **Technical Solution**:
    Frontend uses Cesium + TypeScript + MCP SDK for digital Earth display and interactive control, supporting real-time map operations and attraction visualization. Backend uses Node.js + WebSocket for frontend operation control, Python + FastAPI for LLM service interfaces. Integrated OpenAI + LangChain for generating personalized route recommendations and explanatory text, achieving high-concurrency access capability and real-time map operation support.

  - **Project Results**:
    Users can quickly view travel routes through digital Earth and receive AI-generated personalized explanations. System can control frontend maps in real-time, achieving attraction highlighting, route display, and explanation synchronization, significantly improving user experience. Independently completed frontend/backend development and LLM integration, achieving end-to-end intelligent tour guide service implementation with high-concurrency access capability and real-time map operation support.

- ### GeoAI Agent Web Platform (2024.11-2025.07)

  - **Project Overview**:
    LLM-based intelligent agent web platform that transforms traditional GIS systems into intelligent systems, achieving natural language-driven spatiotemporal task automation. Through web frontend interface, users can complete complex GIS operations such as UAV scheduling, spatial queries, and data analysis through natural language interaction, significantly reducing system usage barriers.

  - **Technical Solution**:
    Frontend built with modern React + TypeScript for interactive web interface, integrated WebSocket for real-time communication. Backend uses Python FastAPI to build RESTful API services, integrated DeepSeek LLM for instruction fine-tuning and private deployment. Developed MCP (Model Context Protocol) service to connect agents with business systems, built GIS data parsing and context interfaces to transform complex spatiotemporal data into structured information for model processing.
